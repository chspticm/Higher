# SQA Higher Computing Science v3.0

## Implementation (data types and structures) 	
Describe, exemplify and implement appropriately the following structures:
- parallel 1D arrays
- records
- arrays of records

## Implementation (computational constructs) 
Describe, exemplify and implement the appropriate constructs in a procedural high-level (textual) language:
- parameter passing (formal and actual)
- the scope of local and global variables

sub-programs/routines, defined by their name and arguments (inputs and outputs):
- functions
- procedures

Pre-defined functions (with parameters):
- to create substrings ( string[start:end] )
- to convert from character to ASCII ( ord() ) and vice versa ( chr() )
- to convert floating-point numbers to integers ( int() )
- modulus ( % )

file handling:
- sequential CSV (open, create, read, write, close)
- txt files (open, create, read, write, close)

Read and explain code that makes use of the above constructs

## Implementation (algorithm specification) 	
Describe, exemplify and implement standard algorithms using 1D arrays or arrays of records:
- count occurrences
- find minimum 
- find maximum
- linear search
