# Higher Algorithms Tasks
Each bullet point is a task. in the form
- Filename
    - Task Description
Save each task with the filename of the main bullet point. copy and paste the description into the file, add your name and date. By now all of your programs should be modular. Use the "Higher Algorithms.md" file to track your progress

## File Access
- Reading from text file - Single Value
    - Read the contents of file1.txt and display them on screen
- Writing to text file - Single Value
    - Write your name to the file name.txt
- Reading from text file - Multiple Value
    - Read the contents of file2.txt into an Array name[4] String) and then display the array contents. 
- Writing to text file - Multiple Value
    - Enter five test scores (0-100) into an Array and write the array to the file scores.txt.
- Reading from CSV file into parallel arrays
    - Read the contents of the file file3.csv into the following arrays name[5] (String), score[5] (Integer), pass[5] (Boolean)
- Writing parallel arrays into a CSV file
    - Enter 5 place names and their populations into an Array, write the contents of the arrays to the file places.txt
- Reading from CSV file into array of records
    - Read the contents of the file file4.csv into the array of records birds[10] Bird(name (string), wingspan (real), species (string)) display the array’s contents in a table 
- Writing from an array of records into a CSV file
    - Create an array of record[5] people(forename(string), day of birth(integer), month of birth(integer), year of birth(integer)), populate the array and write it to the file friends.csv
  
## String Handling / Slicing
- Extract Character from the left of a string
    - Display the first 5 letters of the string ‘Computing’
- Extract Character from the right of a string
    - Display the last 5 letters of the string ‘Science’
- Extract Character from the middle of a string
    - Display from the 3rd to 8th characters of ‘Save the world’
- Concatenate a new string from the sub-strings of two or more other strings
    - Display the string using the first 5 characters of ‘Robertson’ and last 2 of ‘2025’

## Pre-defined functions
- Convert from ASCII to Character
    - Use a loop to display your name in ASCII codes
- Convert from Character to ASCII
    - Display the ASCII codes for a..z and A..Z in a table with the character
- Modulus
    - Display the number of meters and centimetres separately for 5 given heights (1.85, 2.60, 1.5, 3.67, 4.98)
